# Codeforces Solutions

This includes my solutions for Codeforces problems. This will include the competitions I took part in and what were my solutions for the problems that I came acorss.

## Template for solving problems

This is written for C++.

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{   
    // These should be commented during submission
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);

    int numTestCases;
    std::cin >> numTestCases;

    while(numTestCases--){
        // Start solving from here
    }
}
```
